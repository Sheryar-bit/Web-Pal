## What is Web Pal
Web Pal is a full-stack, AI-powered platform that enables users to generate fully functional, responsive websites within minutes—simply by describing what they want in natural language.

Built for entrepreneurs, developers, and non-tech users alike, this platform eliminates the need for manual coding by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate clean, structured code based on user prompts.

The platform is designed to be scalable, modular, and production-ready. It integrates prompt parsing, code generation, template rendering, and optional auto-deployment, allowing users to either preview their websites in real-time or export them as downloadable packages.

This project not only showcases the power of generative AI in software development but also demonstrates a practical application of AI in reducing development time, enhancing accessibility, and empowering users to bring their ideas to life—instantly.
